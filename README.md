## Mnemonics to Help Remember Concepts

* The goal of these mnemonics is to help memorize the 49 processes in the PMBOK 6 chart.
* These videos provide some useful suggestions.
  * Memorize the 49 processes in PMBOK 6 using mnemonics and patterns (16 minutes) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAz-6M-RAV0
  * Memorize the 49 processes in PMBOK 6 using a house metaphore and keywords (22 minutes) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgc86nZawAM

### PMBOK 6 Process Groups and Knowledge Areas Matrix

This first section has some strategies to remember the row and column names and the general shape of the matrix.

| Mnemonic | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Initiated Projects Eventually Must Close. | (Column Names) Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitor & Control, Closing |
| Project managers who Integrate Scale, Schedule, Cost, and Quality Human Communication Risk Procuring Stakeholders | (Row Names) Integrate, Scale, Schedule, Cost, Quality, (Human) Resources, Communication, Risk, Procurement, Stakeholders |
| 5 x 10 = 50 (adjust to 49) | There are 49 processes. 5 x 10 = 50, but nothing is perfect in project management so it's ajusted to 49. |
| The biggest job is planning so almost half of the processes are in Planning | Planning (24 processes) |
| The next biggest job is monitoring. Half of Planning is in Monitoring. | Monitor & Control (12 processes) |
| Executing has a little less than Monitoring. There are two fewer. | Executing (10 processes) |
| Closing is easy. There's only one. | Closing (1 process) |
| Initation has what is left. There's only two. | Initating (2 processes) |
| You can use a phone number to know the number of processes for each knowledge area. (766)436-3734 | Integrate (7), Scope (6), Schedule (6), Cost (4), Quality (3), Resources (6), Communication (3), Risk (7), Procuring (3), Stakeholders (4) |
| Or you can use a mnemonic to remember the numbers. A 76 year old man was married to a 64 year old woman for 36 years. They had 3 kids who were 7 feet, 3 feet, and 4 feet tall. | Integrate (7), Scope (6), Schedule (6), Cost (4), Quality (3), Resources (6), Communication (3), Risk (7), Procuring (3), Stakeholders (4) |

The overall matrix looks like a building with a flat roof. The roof hangs over the walls on both sides. The building has a window in the middle, just under the roof. There is a porch on the left side of the building.

### Initiation Process Group

This section has some ways to help remember the cell contents in the Initiation column. There are only two rows that containt text - Integration, Stakeholder.

| Mnemonic | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Do It! | Develop project charter, Identify stakeholders |
| I Can Start! | develop project Charter, identify Stakeholders |
